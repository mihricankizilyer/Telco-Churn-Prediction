## `Business Problem: Churn Customer Forecast`

The data set includes the demographic information, behavior, location information, and population information of the relevant region of a Telecom company presented on IBM Business Analytics. The aim is to predict customer abandonment using this information.

# `Variables`:
- status
- services
- population
- location
- churn
- demographics


## `K-Means by Population and Satisfaction Score`:

• Address information was obtained from the Geocode information and accordingly, 1302 new distinct regions were created.

• Clusters are separated according to the K-Means method by applying the Min-Max scale according to Population and Satisfaction Score.

• The optimum number of clusters is 6.

• Labeling process was performed according to the result of this method.


## `Retention Plan`:

- It has been observed that the group with the Churn probability class "Very High" and "High" has a weighted monthly contract. Providing free "streaming music" service for the first 3 months in return for the long-term transfer of these customers' contracts
